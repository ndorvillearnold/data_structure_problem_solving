This repository contains my learning journey about palindromes, a fundamental concept in data structures and algorithms. Below, you will find key details about the concept of palindromes, examples, and the data structures I explored while studying them.

I am working on learning more about data structures

# Data Structures and Algorithms: 




**Palindrome**
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Palindromes are important in the study of string manipulation, pattern matching, and recursion.

## Examples

- "madam"
- "racecar"
- "level"
- "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
- "12321

- ## Applications

- **Data validation**: Palindromes are used in programs to check and validate symmetric structures in data.
- **String manipulation**: Many string algorithms, including those related to compression and encryption, involve detecting or using palindromes.
- **DNA sequencing**: In bioinformatics, palindromic sequences often indicate important biological structures, such as restriction sites in DNA.
- **Reversible data**: Palindromes are used in algorithms that require reversible or symmetrical patterns.
